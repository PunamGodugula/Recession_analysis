## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of recessions on GDP growth over time. We use historical GDP growth data to identify recession periods and calculate various metrics to understand their severity and duration.

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis contains quarterly GDP growth data and a binary indicator for recession periods. Each row represents a quarter, and columns include the time period, GDP growth rate, and recession indicator.

## Analysis

We perform the following analyses:

1. Identification of recession periods.
2. Calculation of recession severity and duration metrics.
3. Visualization of GDP growth trends and recession periods.
